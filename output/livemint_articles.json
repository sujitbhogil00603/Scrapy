    "Article Content": "In Chhattisgarh's Sukma district, two couples and a woman were allegedly beaten to death on suspicion of practising witchcraft. Five villagers have been detained and are being interrogated. The incident occurred in Ektal village under Konta police station limits. A similar incident happened recently in Balodabazar-Bhatapara district, where four family members were killed over black magic suspicions. Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar highlighted India's unstoppable rise, stating the country is no longer a 'sleeping giant'. Speaking at Ramdeobaba University in Nagpur, he emphasized that education should be seen as a service, not commerce. Dhankhar also noted the removal of corrupt middlemen and praised artificial intelligence as a tool for good governance. The Street is eagerly anticipating the listing of Bajaj Housing Finance, which received a record response to its IPO last week. According to grey market trends and analysts' estimates, the company’s shares are expected to deliver multibagger returns to investors. The current GMP for the stock is approximately Rs 84, reflecting a premium of nearly 120% over the issue price. Domestic benchmark equity indices, Sensex and Nifty50, closed marginally lower on Friday, weighed down by FMCG and energy stocks. However, they recorded their best weekly performance since the end of June, ahead of a likely rate cut by the Federal Reserve.

    "Article Content": "In Chhattisgarh's Sukma district, two couples and a woman were allegedly beaten to death on suspicion of practising witchcraft. Five villagers have been detained and are being interrogated. The incident occurred in Ektal village under Konta police station limits. A similar incident happened recently in Balodabazar-Bhatapara district, where four family members were killed over black magic suspicions. Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar highlighted India's unstoppable rise, stating the country is no longer a 'sleeping giant'. Speaking at Ramdeobaba University in Nagpur, he emphasized that education should be seen as a service, not commerce. Dhankhar also noted the removal of corrupt middlemen and praised artificial intelligence as a tool for good governance. If you care about the environment, think twice about using AI. Generative artificial intelligence uses 30 times more energy than a traditional search engine, warns researcher Sasha Luccioni, on a mission to raise awareness about the environmental impact of the hot new technology. \"I find it particularly disappointing that generative AI is used to search the Internet,\"on the sidelines of the ALL IN artificial intelligence conference, in Montreal. Flagship carrier Air Canada said Sunday it has reached a last-minute tentative deal with its pilots, averting a crippling strike that would have grounded flights and risked devastating the economy. \"Air Canada has reached a tentative, four-year collective agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), representing more than 5,200 pilots at Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge,\" the airline said in a statement. Cathay Cargo, part of Cathay Pacific Airways, is in talks with an Indian airline to use its Hong Kong-based cargo terminal. The facility has a capacity of 2.7 million tonnes annually and aims for net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Cathay Cargo also focuses on sustainability and operational efficiency improvements. In an interview with PTI, Meta India vice president Sandhya Devanathan said India is the leading market for short-form video Reels' watch-time on Instagram. The Facebook and Instagram parent Meta is upbeat about the pace and extent to which Reels has caught on with creators and brands alike. Essar Group's IT arm, Black Box, aims to grow its India business share by 1-2 percentage points as it targets USD 2 billion in revenue by 2027-28. The company plans to leverage its global expertise and expand its workforce in India from 600 to around 1,000 employees. Black Box focuses on sectors like banking, finance, healthcare, technology, and industrial. Every now and then the market goes through phases, where it prefers a certain set of stocks, not based on sector but based on the overall market cap. So, sometimes it is large caps, at other mid-caps. Now this partially happens, due to the flows which are coming to markets. For example, if more flows are coming to mid-cap or multicap schemes there is bound to be out performance in the mid-cap space. When flows for large caps would increase as has been the case in the month of August. they performed better. Now what it does is that it tends to create a sudden surge in mid-cap or the large cap. Similarly when there is an outflow like the kind of one which we saw in March 2024, midcap stocks tend to decline sharply. Essentially, it is the flows which impact the broader matrix of how midcaps behave. Modi 3.0 has completed its first 100 days, achieving several targets set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The government has cleared projects worth Rs 3 lakh crore, focusing on infrastructure and farming. Initiatives for youth employment, women empowerment, and tribal development have been launched. Efforts in healthcare, security, and cybercrime mitigation have also been highlighted. Arvind Kejriwal announced his resignation as Delhi's Chief Minister, to be effective in two days. He plans to stay out of office until the upcoming elections, urging voters to support him if they believe in his honesty. The Election Commission's decision on early polls remains uncertain. The local meteorological department has issued a 'yellow' alert for thunderstorms and lightning in six districts of Himachal Pradesh on Sunday and Wednesday. Intermittent rains have been recorded, with Kasauli receiving the highest rainfall of 53 mm. Over 40 roads are closed, and 53 power supply schemes disrupted. The state has faced significant losses and casualties during this monsoon season. India needs to boost container production, promote domestic use, strengthen shipping firms, and enhance port infrastructure. High freight costs, container shortages, and reliance on foreign carriers challenge exports.

    "Article Content": "India needs to boost container production, promote domestic use, strengthen shipping firms, and enhance port infrastructure. High freight costs, container shortages, and reliance on foreign carriers challenge exports. Domestic shipping handles only 5-10% of trade volume, with heavy dependence on Chinese containers making India vulnerable to supply disruptions. The Reserve Bank of India plans to modernise its currency management infrastructure over the next 4-5 years. This includes creating new currency management centres, introducing warehouse automation, and enhancing security systems. The goal is to ensure adequate storage and handling capacity for future cash needs while maintaining efficiency and security.

    "Article Content": "Kerala Health Minister Veena George confirmed that a man who recently died in Malappuram was infected with Nipah virus. The outbreak in Malappuram has been contained, and restrictions have been lifted after a 42-day double incubation period. All 472 people under observation have been cleared and removed from the contact list. In Chhattisgarh's Sukma district, two couples and a woman were allegedly beaten to death on suspicion of practising witchcraft. Five villagers have been detained and are being interrogated. The incident occurred in Ektal village under Konta police station limits. A similar incident happened recently in Balodabazar-Bhatapara district, where four family members were killed over black magic suspicions. Kasol is renowned as India's best hill station. It's a charming village in the Kullu district, known as the \"Amsterdam of India.\" Here, you may take in Himachal Pradesh's stunning scenery and life-changing experiences to make your journey worthwhile. Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar highlighted India's unstoppable rise, stating the country is no longer a 'sleeping giant'. Speaking at Ramdeobaba University in Nagpur, he emphasized that education should be seen as a service, not commerce. Dhankhar also noted the removal of corrupt middlemen and praised artificial intelligence as a tool for good governance. The local meteorological department has issued a 'yellow' alert for thunderstorms and lightning in six districts of Himachal Pradesh on Sunday and Wednesday. Intermittent rains have been recorded, with Kasauli receiving the highest rainfall of 53 mm. Over 40 roads are closed, and 53 power supply schemes disrupted. The state has faced significant losses and casualties during this monsoon season. Maldives Foreign Minister Moosa Zameer has stated that initial misunderstandings with India have been resolved following the repatriation of Indian troops. He emphasized strong ties with both China and India. Zameer also dismissed the need for an IMF bailout, citing temporary economic challenges and ongoing reforms to address fiscal issues. The Maldives continues to strengthen bilateral relations with key allies. Undiscovered beach destination Diu is located close to the Gujarat border. You can obtain some privacy from the frantic crowds that are frequently encountered at well-known beach locations here because there are less people here. In Wayanad district, the usual Onam celebrations have been halted due to the devastating landslides on July 30.

    "Article Content": "As the cryptocurrency market evolves, investors are exploring underrated tokens beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Anush Jafer from Mudrex highlighted 10 promising cryptocurrencies during an ETMarkets live stream, emphasizing the value of diversifying across small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap tokens for a resilient portfolio. On Friday, blue-chip cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum fell as investors anticipated a critical U.S. jobs report that could impact the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rate cuts. On September 5, the cryptocurrency market experienced a modest rebound, with Bitcoin and Ethereum gaining 1.2% and 1.3%, respectively. Other major coins like Solana and Dogecoin also saw notable increases. Despite the recovery, the Fear & Greed index fell to 34, signaling cautious market sentiment. Bitcoin is currently priced below $57,000, indicating a period of consolidation before any significant upward movement. However, there's optimism for the near future as the October-December quarter historically favors Bitcoin's performance. If you have available funds, consider gradually investing in promising assets to take advantage of potential gains. Bitcoin and Ether fell up to 5% due to U.S. economic slowdown fears and weak ISM manufacturing data. The global crypto market cap dropped below $2 trillion.  In an ETMarkets live stream with Delta Exchange, Saketh Ramakrishna explained the Iron Condor strategy for managing risk in volatile cryptocurrency markets. This non-directional strategy profits from low volatility and was illustrated with a real-world case study showing its practical application and benefits. At 1:54 pm IST, Bitcoin was trading at $58,027, a decrease of nearly 0.5%, while Ethereum had slipped by 0.9% to $2,461. The past week has been challenging for Bitcoin, with a drop of nearly 9%, following a 10% decline in August after briefly reaching $64,000 earlier that month. Edul Patel, Mudrex CEO, attributed Bitcoin's dip below $60,000 to increased selling pressure and outflows from Bitcoin spot ETFs. He warned that if this trend continues, Bitcoin could fall to the $55,700 support level. The U.S. faces pivotal events with the September FOMC meeting and November elections, influencing traditional and crypto markets. Bitcoin's highs and new ETFs signal mainstream acceptance, while Gen Z and Millennials push for crypto-friendly policies, impacting election dynamics and regulatory focus. Major cryptocurrencies declined on Friday, with Bitcoin below $59,500 and altcoins like XRP and Solana dropping. The global market cap fell 1% to $2.08 trillion amid regulatory and earnings concerns. VeChain (VET), a blockchain platform focusing on supply chain management, shows strong growth potential. With robust fundamentals, industry partnerships, and expanding market integration, VET's price has bullish projections from $0.03 to $0.50 by 2030. Continued adoption and innovations are key drivers for VeChain’s future success. Cryptocurrencies rose on Thursday ahead of key U.S. GDP and job data. Bitcoin gained nearly 1% to $59,724, while Ethereum rose 3.6% to $2,557. Market cap increased to $2.1 trillion. Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, explained, \"Bitcoin’s drop below $60,000 and Ethereum's nearly 7% fall were driven by a wave of liquidations totaling over $300 million. This was sparked by investor uncertainty and a general market downturn. Despite this setback, the long-term outlook remains positive due to strong fundamentals and ongoing institutional interest.\" Nasdaq is awaiting regulatory approval to launch and trade options on a bitcoin index. This move would provide institutional investors and traders an alternative way to hedge their exposure to bitcoin. The options would track the CME CF Bitcoin Real-Time Index, supplementing the recently launched leveraged ETFs tied to bitcoin. Stablecoins currently dominate the crypto market, accounting for a significant 92.98% of the total 24-hour trading volume at $61.7 billion. Bitcoin, despite a market cap dip to $1.242 trillion, still holds a 56.26% dominance. Its trading volume surged by 43.6% to $28.15 billion in the last 24 hours. Crypto expert Saketh Ramakrishna discussed the Iron Condor strategy on ETMarkets, highlighting its effectiveness in managing Bitcoin's volatility and comparing it to traditional market strategies. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) saw slight declines to $63,650 and $2,730, respectively, after nearing $65,000 and $2,900 over the weekend. This shift followed comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on potential rate cuts.  After a periodic scare, the global markets have adopted an upward momentum, showcasing signs of recovery from previous lows. However, while other markets (equity for example) show resilience based on the expectation of a Federal rate cut, the crypto market is yet to register a prolonged upward boom.  Web3's early solution to scalability issues was modularity—breaking down blockchain tasks into separate components. This resulted in the creation of various layer-2 solutions, rollups, sidechains, and state channels, which boosted scalability but also caused increased fragmentation. Each new solution formed its own ecosystem with separate liquidity pools, user bases, and a steeper learning curve for developers and users. UPI, on the other hand, is gaining currency by the day. The UPI transactions hit Rs 20.64 lakh crore in the month of July growing by 35% year-on year. It's the third straight month of Rs 20 lakh crore worth of transactions. Major cryptocurrencies rose on Friday ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole speech. Bitcoin and Ethereum gained 0.55% and 1.5%, respectively. Traders expect positive signals on rate cuts, boosting crypto. The global crypto market cap increased by 1% to $2.17 trillion. Jafer also touched on the broader implications of this rivalry for the crypto market as a whole. He predicted that the competition between Solana and Ethereum would drive innovation, benefiting the entire blockchain space. \"Healthy competition often leads to better products and services Cryptocurrencies saw notable declines, with Bitcoin dropping by 2.3% and Ethereum falling by 2.8%, ahead of key U.S. economic data. Anticipated policy moves and labor data revisions could influence market directions. Experts suggested potential rallies for Bitcoin if jobless claims decrease, while other major cryptocurrencies like BNB and Solana also faced downturns. On Tuesday, Bitcoin and Ether prices surged up to 4% amid hopes for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Investors eagerly awaited insights from the Fed's July meeting minutes and Jerome Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium. Mandiant Solutions, a Google subsidiary and cybersecurity expert, confirmed that cryptocurrency exchange WazirX's laptops were secure amidst a cyberattack that stole over $230 million. Investigations to recover assets and identify culprits continue. On Monday, Bitcoin fell 1.6% to $58,652, whereas Ethereum gained 0.5% to $2,620. Market experts mentioned uncertainty and selling pressure affecting Bitcoin's performance. Bitcoin remained within the $58,000 to $59,000 range amid significant economic data and geopolitical tensions. Investors monitored Consumer Price Index figures, retail earnings, and geopolitics. Key support for Bitcoin was $56,300, with resistance at $58,660. Ethereum faced challenges above $2,400. Goldman Sachs purchased $418 million in Bitcoin ETFs, highlighting increasing institutional adoption. Cryptocurrency prices showed mixed trends today, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, Solana, and XRP trading slightly higher, while Toncoin, Dogecoin, Avalanche, Shiba Inu, and Polkadot traded marginally lower. In a recent ETMarkets live stream, crypto trader Saketh discussed strategies for managing crypto market volatility. Key points included diversification, using stop-loss orders, and leveraging technical analysis. Emphasizing a long-term investment perspective, the session aimed to educate viewers on navigating the risks associated with the unpredictable crypto market. Initially launched as a project by Telegram in 2017, The Open Network (TON) has grown into a significant blockchain ecosystem. Following its separation from Telegram, the project was rebranded and has since set its sights on transforming the digital landscape, with the goal of creating a universal app similar to WeChat by 2028. The project's ambitious vision is outlined in its white paper, released on July 26, 2021. Hedge funds, pensions, and banks invested significantly in Bitcoin-focused ETFs as the asset gained mainstream acceptance with the help of US regulators. Major players like Millennium Management and other firms from around the world engaged. The funds experienced a net inflow of $17 billion this year, bolstered by BlackRock's $20 billion IBIT. WazirX announced on Wednesday that it is ending its custody arrangement with Liminal Custody following a major hack that resulted in the theft of Rs 2,000 crore ($230 million) from its multisig wallet.  Bitcoin and Ethereum traded higher on Tuesday, ahead of key U.S. economic data releases that could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions. Ethereum, currently priced at $2,679.08 USD, has experienced considerable price fluctuations. Analysis indicates short-term stability and long-term growth potential. With price targets between $3,500 to $35,000 by 2030, the future of Ethereum looks promising, driven by expanding use cases and significant adoption. Market trends and technological developments are key factors affecting its future value. The crypto market has had a bearish but sensational start to August, with Bitcoin hovering around $57,000 and altcoins experiencing significant declines. The recent market correction, triggered by macroeconomic and inflation-related fears, has presented an opportunity for investors to accumulate promising crypto assets at attractive prices. Since Bitcoin was released, it has grown rapidly to become the top new asset class in the world. While world governments did not perceive it as a financial changemaker asset at first, the significant adoption rates globally have forced them to think otherwise During an ETMarkets live stream, experienced crypto trader Saketh detailed strategies for managing the volatile cryptocurrency market. He emphasized technical analysis and liquidity considerations, distinguishing genuine recoveries from temporary rebounds. Saketh's approach involves strategic trade placement and adjustments based on market trends. Traders were advised to stay cautious and adaptable.

    "Article Content": "In sectors like banking when a regulatory rejig takes place, every player has to follow a new set of rules. It is not possible for any entity to escape the regulatory regime. This leads to a situation where entities which are large or are already following best practices are able to make transition to a new regime in a short span of time and are the first one to get rewarded on the street. Others who take time to the follow which normally are smaller or mid sized players tend to get attention later. There is a set of quasi private sector banks which have taken time to change but now that they have changed it is getting reflected in their numbers. Check out Stock Reports Plus, powered by Refinitiv, for price targets of over 4,000 listed stocks along with detailed company analysis focusing on five key components - earnings, fundamentals, relative valuation, risk and price momentum to generate standardized scores.

    "Authors": [],
    "Article Content": "The majority of retail traders and investors have a bullish bias in stock markets. There is a good enough reason why this bullish bias got developed. First is that our market ecosystem is built in a manner that it pushes you to be bullish. Right from buy and hold concept and the fact that over the years, bullish bias has been rewarded are few of them. But markets see different phases, ranging from bullish, bearish, high volatility with bearish bias. So what about finding a set of stocks, which have higher probability of meeting criteria which suits the underlying bias of the large majority of investors which is “buy and hold” but with an additional probability that majority of these stocks should give return after witnessing all the volatility which is bound to happen in the market.

    "Title": "Own midcaps? Do a check & balance exercise as volatility may spike: 4 midcaps from different sectors for long-term investors",
    "Authors": [],
    "Article Content": "Every now and then the market goes through phases, where it prefers a certain set of stocks, not based on sector but based on the overall market cap. So, sometimes it is large caps, at other mid-caps. Now this partially happens, due to the flows which are coming to markets. For example, if more flows are coming to mid-cap or multicap schemes there is bound to be out performance in the mid-cap space. When flows for large caps would increase as has been the case in the month of August. they performed better. Now what it does is that it tends to create a sudden surge in mid-cap or the large cap. Similarly when there is an outflow like the kind of one which we saw in March 2024, midcap stocks tend to decline sharply. Essentially, it is the flows which impact the broader matrix of how midcaps behave. Gift A Story Share member-only stories with your friends or family and help them read it for free.

The government has cleared projects worth Rs 3 lakh crore, focusing on infrastructure and farming. Initiatives for youth employment, women empowerment, and tribal development have been launched. Efforts in healthcare, security, and cybercrime mitigation have also been highlighted. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has accused the JMM-led coalition in Jharkhand of supporting Bangladeshi and Rohingya infiltrators for vote bank politics. He claims these infiltrators are altering the demography of Santhal Parganas and Kolhan regions, causing a decline in the tribal population. Modi also criticized the JMM, RJD, and Congress for corruption and vowed that BJP will investigate deaths during excise constable recruitment if elected. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday accused the ruling JMM-led coalition in Jharkhand of patronising Bangladeshi and Rohingya infiltration for vote bank politics. He said infiltrators from the neighbouring country are a major threat to Jharkhand as they are changing the demography of the Santhal Parganas and Kolhan regions of the state. Modi 3.0 has completed its first 100 days, achieving several targets set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The government has cleared projects worth Rs 3 lakh crore, focusing on infrastructure and farming. Initiatives for youth employment, women empowerment, and tribal development have been launched. Efforts in healthcare, security, and cybercrime mitigation have also been highlighted. Arvind Kejriwal announced his resignation as Delhi's Chief Minister, to be effective in two days. He plans to stay out of office until the upcoming elections, urging voters to support him if they believe in his honesty. The Election Commission's decision on early polls remains uncertain. Bengaluru, September 15 (ANI):  In a major breach of security, an unknown individual rushed toward K’taka CM Siddaramaiah in the middle of his programme. The police quickly responded to evade the man as the incident left CM Siddaramaiah completely startled. However, no official statements have been received from the police yet. An investigation into the matter is underway and more details will follow.   Prime Minister Narendra Modi has accused the JMM-led coalition in Jharkhand of supporting Bangladeshi and Rohingya infiltrators for vote bank politics. He claims these infiltrators are altering the demography of Santhal Parganas and Kolhan regions, causing a decline in the tribal population. Modi also criticized the JMM, RJD, and Congress for corruption and vowed that BJP will investigate deaths during excise constable recruitment if elected. Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara confirmed the arrest of BJP MLA N Munirathna, who faces charges including issuing death threats to a BBMP contractor. The arrest follows complaints of harassment, casteist slurs, and criminal intimidation. Munirathna denies the allegations, calling them a conspiracy. The state BJP has issued a show cause notice demanding his clarification within five days. In a surprising move on Sunday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced he will resign in two days, following his recent bail in a corruption case related to Delhi's scrapped liquor policy. Kejriwal stated he will only return to the Chief Minister's role if the public gives him a \"certificate of honesty\" through their vote, and he is advocating for early elections in Delhi, aligning them with those in Maharashtra. The Supreme Court's bail conditions include barring him from entering the Chief Minister's office or signing official documents, which BJP leader Shehzad Poonawalla criticized as leaving Kejriwal with a largely ceremonial role. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's resignation announcement has been criticised by BJP leaders, calling it a political maneuver to gain sympathy. Kejriwal stated he would resign in two days and not return as CM until the public declares him honest. AAP supports his decision, emphasising his commitment to honesty and transparency. Launching a scathing attack on the BJP-led Centre, Delhi Chief Minister and AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday that even Britishers wouldn't have thought that after 75 years of independence, there would come a ruler more cruel than them. Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday announced that he will resign from his post as the Chief Minister of Delhi after 2 days and will only come back after winning people's trust. The Aam Aadmi Party National Convenor also demanded early elections in the capital. \"(The Supreme) Court has done what it could by ruling in my favour and granting me bail. Today, I come to the people's court to ask you whether you consider Kejriwal guilty or honest. In two days, I will resign from the CM's position, and I won’t sit in that chair until the people decide,\" he said while addressing his party workers in Delhi. Arvind Kejriwal said he wants to give 'agnipariksha' after coming out of jail. Kejriwal also demanded for early elections in Delhi. \"Delhi elections due in February but I demand elections in the national capital be held in November with Maharashtra,\" he said.
